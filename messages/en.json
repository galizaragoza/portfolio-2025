    "masterDescription": "Master's in Full-Stack Development from Nuclio Digital School (October 2023 – March 2024), which I completed intensively and online covering both front-end and back-end topics. I learned and applied key technologies —React, JavaScript (HTML, CSS, and Tailwind), Node.js, WebSockets, and MongoDB— and delved into web protocols, coding best practices, and security in development. I worked under agile methodologies (SCRUM) and used version control with Git as well as continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes. Thanks to practical projects, I strengthened my communication, adaptability, teamwork, and mediation skills, developing real end-to-end solutions and collaborating effectively with my peers to ensure application quality and scalability.",
